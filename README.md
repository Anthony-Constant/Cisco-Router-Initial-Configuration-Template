# Cisco Router Initial Configuration Template

## Introduction
This repository contains a basic Cisco router configuration template designed to provide a starting point for configuring Cisco routers in network environments. The template includes essential configurations for setting up interfaces, routing, security, and management settings.

## How It Works
The configuration template is structured in a way that makes it easy to deploy on Cisco routers. It provides placeholders for values that need to be customized according to your specific network requirements. Once customized, the template can be copied and pasted directly into the router's command-line interface (CLI) for configuration.

## Features
- Simplified configuration: The template includes pre-configured settings for common router configurations.
- Security enhancements: Configuration includes security settings such as enabling SSH and setting an enable secret password.
- Customization: Placeholder values allow easy customization to adapt the configuration to your network environment.
- Banner message: Includes a customizable login banner for security compliance.

## Getting Started
To use this configuration template:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `cisco_router_config_template.txt` file.
3. Customize the placeholder values (`<Placeholder>`) with appropriate values for your network environment.
4. Copy the customized configuration template.
5. Access your Cisco router's CLI (command-line interface).
6. Enter global configuration mode and paste the configuration template.
7. Verify and save the configuration.

## Dependencies
- Cisco router: This configuration template is intended for use with Cisco routers running IOS (Internetwork Operating System).
- Knowledge of Cisco IOS commands: Basic understanding of Cisco IOS commands is required to customize and deploy the configuration template.

## Requirements
Access to a network device's command-line interface.
Basic understanding of network configurations.
Necessary privileges to modify device settings.
